# langproc-2021-cw-Porcupines
Implemented a C to MIPS compiler using ANSI C grammar as parser language, Flex to perform lexical analysis, and C++ for code generation. 

This compiler is capable of producing assembly code for several important C language features including : integers, function calls, floats, doubles, loops, and conditional statements. By observing the make-file for this project we can identify the relevant dependencies to include to enable this project to be built.
